## WeakLeak Solution

Our app tackles food waste by allowing users to take a photo of their food bills, which is then processed by AI-driven OCR to identify the types of food purchased. Users can track their food waste by logging discarded items in the app. The app utilizes this information to remind users before the given food goes bad in the future. Once users stop wasting that type of food, the app ceases to send reminders for that type. Users can also monitor their food waste through a convenient dashboard.

## Food Waste In Households

In households, food waste is a common problem resulting from forgetfulness and failure to use up the food before expiration, leading to financial losses, environmental impact, squandering of resources, and greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the need for a solution to track food, minimize waste, and promote responsible consumption.
